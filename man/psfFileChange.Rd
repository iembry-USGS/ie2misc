\arguments{
\item{file}{Input .psf file(s) to change specific SkewSE, GenSkew, and
SkewOpt information to be selected through a file dialog.}

\item{interactive}{If interactive is TRUE, then the user will select the
filenames(s) to use for saving with the file dialog. In order to select
more than one file, the user must hold down the Ctrl (Control) button
while mouse clicking the chosen files. If interactive is \code{FALSE}, then
the user will select the directory, via the directory dialog, to use for
saving and the original filenames will be used.}

\item{path}{Directory path of .psf files, to be selected through a
directory dialog, to change specific SkewSE, GenSkew, and SkewOpt
information. The user will be asked where to find the .psf files
& then the user will be asked where to save the revised .psf files.}
}
\value{
Revised .psf text file(s)
}
\description{
The .psf file is a script file that records the specifications used to run
the USGS PeakFQ program (\url{http://water.usgs.gov/software/PeakFQ/}) for
a station. psfFileChange and psfFileChangeBATCH modify the original .psf
settings.
}
\details{
psfFileChange searches for a character vector of patterns (SkewSE,
  GenSkew, and SkewOpt) in single or multiple .psf file(s) to replace. If
  the patterns are missing, then the patterns are added to the file(s).
  This is done for a single file or multiple files that the user selects.
  Although these changes are currently pre-determined, future versions may
  allow the user to change particular settings (for example, how
  outliers are handled).

psfFileChangeBATCH searches for a character vector of patterns
  (SkewSE, GenSkew, and SkewOpt) in a directory of .psf files to replace. If
  the patterns are missing, then the patterns are added to the files. This
  is done in a BATCH mode (whole directory of .psf files). Although these
  changes are currently pre-determined, future versions may allow the
  user to change particular settings (for example, how outliers are handled).
