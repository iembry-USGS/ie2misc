\arguments{
\item{file}{Input .exp file(s), using a file dialog, to obtain 1) the
goodness-of-fit and trend results & 2) the exceedance probability values.}

\item{output}{The exported format for each set of results (options are .csv,
.xlsx, and both file types).}

\item{overwrite}{logical vector that determines whether the existing
should be overwritten or not.}

\item{path}{Directory path of .exp files, to be selected through a directory
dialog, to obtain 1) the goodness-of-fit and trend results & 2) the
exceedance probability values. The user will be asked where to find the
.exp files & then the user will be asked where to save the results files.}
}
\value{
.csv, .xlsx, or both file types with 1) the goodness-of-fit and
  trend results & 2) the exceedance probability values for individual sites
  in separate files. Currently, in the BATCH mode, all stations in the given
  directory are combined in a single data.frame with both 1) and 2).
}
\description{
expFileOutput and expFileOutputBATCH process raw .exp files generated by the
USGS PeakFQ program (\url{http://water.usgs.gov/software/PeakFQ/}). The .exp
output file from running PeakFQ is a shortened version of the longer
narrative .prt file, more suitable for tabulating the model results than the
.prt file; however, the information must be changed to a fixed field format.
}
\details{
expFileOutput converts the user-selected .exp file to 1) a tab-delimited
.csv file for a single station with the goodness-of-fit and trend results
(all station information exists in a single row) and 2) a tab-delimited .csv
file for a single station with the exceedance probability values on each row.
For the .xlsx file, tab 1 contains the goodness-of-fit and trend results and
tab 2 contains the exceedance probability values.

expFileOutputBATCH converts the user-selected directory of .exp files into
1) a tab-delimited .csv file as a single table, with one record for each
station, with the goodness-of-fit and trend results and 2) a tab-delimited
.csv file as a single table, with a set of records for each station, with the
exceedance probability values on each row. For the .xlsx file, tab 1
contains the goodness-of-fit and trend results and tab 2 contains the
exceedance probability values.

In the Examples section, there is R code for the user to view the example
  .exp file.
