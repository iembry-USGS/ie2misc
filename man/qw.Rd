\item{interactive}{If interactive is \code{TRUE}, then the user will select the
filenames(s) to use for saving with the file dialog. In order to select
more than one file, the user must hold down the Ctrl (Control) button
while mouse clicking the chosen files. If interactive is \code{FALSE}, then
the user will select the directory, via the directory dialog, to use for
saving and the original filenames will be used.}

\item{overwrite}{If \code{TRUE}, overwrite any existing spreadsheet.}

\item{path}{Directory path of QW files to be selected through a directory
dialog. The user will be asked where to find the QW files & then the
user will be asked where to save the QW .xlsx files.}

\item{pattern}{The default pattern is \code{.rdb} (the filename has the .rdb
extension). This pattern can be changed by \code{qwBATCH(pattern = "pattern")}.}

\value{
QW .xlsx file(s).

\description{
qw, qw2 and qwBATCH process raw QW files. The QW files can contain "selected
  water-quality data for stations in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
  National Water Information System (NWIS) water-quality database. The data
  you have secured from the USGS NWISWeb database may include data that have
  not received Director's approval and as such are provisional and subject
  to revision."
}
\details{
qw function opens a single or multiple raw, QW file(s) to modify the format
  and then exports the file(s) in .xlsx format. This is done for a single
  file or multiple files that the user selects with a file dialog.

qw2 function opens a single QW file to modify the format and then exports
  the file in .xlsx format. This is done for a single file that the user
  selects without a file dialog.

qwBATCH function opens raw QW files, from a directory, to modify the format
  and then exports the files in .xlsx format.  This is done in a BATCH mode
  (whole directory of QW files) using a directory dialog.

qw, qw2 and qwBATCH functions perform the same processes on the raw QW
  files: 1) remove the first row, 2) create a single column with the Date
  and Time rather than 2 separate Date and Time columns (if needed), and 3)
  exports the QW file as a spreadsheet with three sheets (sheet1 corrects
  the timezones for Daylight Savings Times, sheet2 includes everything
  except for the meta data, and sheet3 provides the meta data from the top
  of the file). The supported US timezones are the following: Eastern,
  Central, Mountain, Pacific, Alaska, Hawai'i, and Atlantic (Puerto Rico
  and US Virgin Islands).
